Contains code that I wrote when doing the CS347 (Operating systems)
minor course at IIT Bombay during Jan-Apr 2022.

Assignment 2 contains code for the XV6 operating system (given as part
of the assignment problem statement), which is distributed under the
MIT license. The extra code in this repository (written by me) is also
covered under the same license.
